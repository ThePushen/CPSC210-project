# Storehouse Trading System

## Trade Items

A *proposal* list:
- This is a **trading system** in a storehouse that allows people *buy* or *sell* items from storehouse and
keep them recorded into their virtual **user account**.
- This application allows users to create their own accounts in the trading system. They are able to *deposit* and 
*withdraw* money into their **user account**. Each user can **store arbitrary items** in their repository and sell or 
buy items.
- Anyone who is interested in buying and keeping items in storehouse **without contacting** any other person.
- During COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to keep a social distance with others. Anyone who trades their items can 
reduce the *contact with others* and *stay safe* as possible.
